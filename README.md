# Important instructions (written based on my environment, needs to be updated upon trying out it other environments too)

## Notes for setting up the environment

### 1. Espressif Rust Tools

ESP32-specific toolchain manager (`espup`):

```bash
cargo install espup
espup install

```

Source the export file generated by this tool in every new terminal session, or add it to your shell config:\*

```bash
. $HOME/export-esp.sh

```

### 2. Build Utilities

```bash
cargo install ldproxy cargo-generate espflash

```

### 3. Some system lbraries (it seems to be arch-specific)

```bash
yay -S libxml2 ncurses5-compat-libs

```

I encountered an error that libxml2 so was not the version 2. So use this hack(need to improve it) to symlink it to the current version(16 in my case) seems to work fine for me.

```bash
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/libxml2.so.16 /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2

```

---

## Other things I had to do to in my environment:

1. Update the permissions. (I know it is temporary and has to be done each time.)

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

```

2. **Edit `src/main.rs`:**
   Update the variables with sensitive info regarding wifi and telegram bot credentials

## Build & Run

Running it flashes it to the esp32 s3 chip too. It will prompt you to choose device.

```bash
cargo run

```
